But every once in a while we travel to a country that leaves us smitten ‚Äì our trip in Bhutan was one such adventure! From the moment we landed till the moment we left, I was left marvelling at the sheer stature of the landscapes, the peace of the surrounding, and the happiness on the faces of Bhutanese people! After having travelled extensively in India, we were thrilled at the prospect of visiting its beautiful neighbouring country.

Here is everything you need to know about planning the ideal trip to Bhutan :-

Druk Air flies directly from Delhi to Paro a couple of times every week. We suggest planning your trip in a way that allows you to opt for these direct flights as they are very convenient. It was our first time flying with Druk Air and the service and aircraft both were above expectation! The best part about this flight are the scenic vistas as you land at Paro Airport ‚Äì so don‚Äôt forget to reserve a window seat for yourself! (left side when travelling from Delhi to Paro and right side on return :-)). We suggest comparing prices and booking here.

Bhutan is an ideal destination to visit year round, except for the months of June-August due to monsoons. Try to coordinate your visit with a local festival ‚Äì most festivals happen during September but others are spread throught the year. We travelled in the month of December and had a great time.

There are countless things to do in Bhutan and we‚Äôve tried to include as many as possible in our guide, but here are a few that you MUST not miss:

Bhutan prides itself on being one of the few carbon negative places in the world. The emphasis on sustainability and the happiness index means that there are rather strict guidelines that discourage mass tourism in the country! For eg it is compulsory for all tourists to have a 24X7 local guide in the country. For this reason, it is best to book the entire trip with 1 hotel chain that can offer a package that includes visas (for nationalities that need it), guide, hotel rooms, experiences, transportation, and all meals. We booked our entire trip with Six Senses Bhutan and cannot recommend the experience enough. You‚Äôll be pampered from the pickup at the airport to the drop off, that is for sure üôÇ

Indian nationals do not need a visa to enter Bhutan, however they are required to have travel insurance for the duration of the trip, a booking at a government enlisted property, a tour guide, and have to pay a Sustainable Development Fee (SDF) of INR 1200 per person per night. All details can be found on this link.

The local currency of Bhutan is Ngultrums, but Indian rupees are widely accepted. 1 BTN = 1 INR (as of Jan 24).

Now that the logistics are out of the way, let‚Äôs go over a day-by-day itinerary, including places and experiences that you definitely need to plan the perfect trip in Bhutan.

Paro Airport is a gorgeous building and offers the perfect introduction to Bhutan. Meet your guide as you exit the airport after passing through immigration and luggage collection and drive to your hotel.

We stayed at Six Senses Thimphu, also known as the Palace In The Clouds. Of all the hotels we stayed in Bhutan, this is one of the most beautiful! Situated high above the valley floor, overlooking apple orchards and young pine forests, with gorgeous views of the Buddha Dordemna, Six Senses Thimphu is the perfect base for exploring Thimpu and kickstarting your trip in Bhutan.

If you can tear yourself away from the incredible views at this hotel, spend the evening enjoying a Jet Lag or Deep Tissue Massage followed by a healing Dotsho bath ‚Äì this treatment is something you must not miss in Bhutan as it is a wellness ritual that uses hot stones and is known to cure joint pains and aches. One thing is for sure ‚Äì it will leave you truly relaxed and rejuvinated for all your adventures in Bhutan

On day 1, we suggest dining at Namhkha, the hotel‚Äôs signature restaurant that offers an array of Bhutanese and continental dishes.



Set aside Day 2 for exploring Thimphu Valley including Buddha Point, Memorial Chorten & its local markets

After breakfast, depart for Changangkha Temple, a sacred pilgrimage site overlooking Thimphu Valley. From here drive towards the iconic 52-meter-tall Buddha Dordenma. This is one of the highlights of the perfect trip to Bhutan. Once you have taken in the sheer size of the Buddha, step inside and discover the 125,000 smaller Buddhas inside (photography is not permitted inside).

Afterwards join Thimphu residents as they pray at the Memorial Chorten. Take in the hustle bustle of Thimphu and if you‚Äôre not tired, try visiting the Folk Heritage Museum, Zorig Chusom, (The National Institute for 13 Arts & Crafts) and the National Textile Museum. You can also visit a local paper making or incense making workshop.

Alternatively you‚Äôre in the mood for a hike, request your hotel to arrange one to Talakha Goemba situated on a ridge at 3,050 m. Rarely visited, this monastery boasts some of the best views of Thimphu Valley. This hike takes approximately 2 hours but is well worth it. On the way down stop at Lungsigang, a charming picnic spot for late afternoon tea and some energy boosting Bhutanese sweets and snacks.

After breakfast in Thimphu, begin your 2.5 hour journey towards Punakha. But make sure you stop en-route at Dochula Pass. On clear days, this pass offers stunning views of the Himalayan range. Take your time admiring the 108 chortens and walk around.

We planned our visit in a way that would allow us to experience one of Bhutan‚Äôs most iconic festivals at Dochula Pass ‚Äì Druk Wangyul gave us the perfect opportunity to experience the rich colors and traditions of Bhutan. This festival, is held in honor of Bhutan‚Äôs fourth king. Apart from the traditional singing and dancing which takes place here, one of the most outstanding features of this special occasion is the scenic beauty of the panoramic Himalayan range which acts as a backdrop for the colourful costumes displayed at the festival.

Gradually the landscape changes to a lush and subtropical valley with charming farmhouses and terraced rice fields. Stop as you enter the valley for a stroll across the rice paddies to Chimi Lhakhang, a fertility temple, to learn about Drukpa Kinley, the revered ‚ÄòDivine Madman‚Äô. The adjacent village has some surprisingly graphic phallic paintings to honor the saint on its homes and shops ‚Äì a truly unique pitstop!

Check in at Six Senses Punakha‚Äôs also known as ‚ÄòFlying Farmhouse‚Äô, as it is home to a unique floating wooden structure that serves as the lodge lounge and reception and offers gorgeous views over the pool and surrounded rice fields. Each of the spacious rooms offer incredible views of the valley and an open-plan living situation with floor to ceiling windows that makes one feel at one with nature.

Enjoy the views and if you‚Äôre in the mood for a bit of exercise in the evening we suggest a hike alongside the river climbing up to Khamsum Yulley Namgyel Chorten, a temple built by the Queen Mother to bring peace to the world. Just a short drive from Punakha Dzong, it takes about 50 minutes to climb from the road through beautiful, terraced rice paddies to reach the chorten which was completed in 1999 after eight years of construction. The visitor is rewarded with stunning views of the valley below just as the sun begins to set.



Wake up early for yet another highlight of this amazing trip to Bhutan! Visit a local monastery, that has been adopted by Six Senses, to join the cutest young monks for a traditional monastic breakfast. Afterwards, spend some time learning more about their lifestyle and sharing a simple breakfast with them.

In the afternoon, cross the country‚Äôs longest suspension bridge on foot before visiting the gorgeous Punakha Dzong, one of Bhutan‚Äôs most impressive landmarks. Located at the confluence of two rivers, Punakha Dzong is six stories high. Take your time to explore this architectural wonder with gorgeous courtyards, murals, and its prayer rooms. Make sure you take lots of photographs as this is a place you‚Äôll want to remember.

Afterwards, experience something truly luxurious if you are staying at Six Senses Punakha! You can catch the sun set over Punakha Dzong as you sip on pomegranate martinis,experience and enjoy light snacks in a rice field with a rushing river as your backdrop. We would highly recommend booking the Pomegranate Martini experience if you are celebrating a special ocassion or planning to propose. It provides the perfect backdrop!

Finally it‚Äôs time to leave Punakha. Paro is a 4 hour drive away. Enroute, you can stop at Rinpung Dzong and The Paro National Museum which displays a fascinating collection of Bhutanese relics. Make sure you walk along the busy streets of the town to explore the local handicraft scene or visit the colorful fresh market. You can also visit one of the colourful karaoke bars for a spot of fun!

From the town it‚Äôs a 20-minute drive up a high mountain road past stunning views of the valley below to the lodge. Six Senses Paro is situated at an elevation of 9,415 ft (2,870 m.) and offers amazing views of the surrounding area! We suggest spending a relaxing evening at the hotel trying local Bhutanese costumes (a kira and a gho) and trying your hand at archery, Bhutan‚Äôs national sport. This is great fun

Have a relaxed dinner at the hotel‚Äôs cosy and scenic restaurant Jangkho. The food here in absolutely scrumptious ‚Äì don‚Äôt forget to try local specialities like momos and Ema Datshi, a hearty Bhutanese curry with chillies. You can also take a momo making class here at the restaurant if you‚Äôre interested!

Set out early this morning on a challenging full day hike to Taktsang Goemba, more famously knowns as Tiger‚Äôs Nest. The hike begins at the base camp in a forested ridge and you will have to climb to an elevation of 2,950 meters. One of the most significant cultural icons of the Kingdom, the highly revered monastery was built on a sheer cliff face above Paro and is visible from the valley floor. During cooler weather clouds can shroud the monastery, highlighting its sanctity and remoteness.

Your guide will share stories of the monastery‚Äôs history along the way. Pine forests decorated with moss and prayer flags surround you as you make your way along the paths of this sacred trail. Hang prayer flags and wish upon the wind. The hike is fairly challenging and takes approximately 4-5 hours. But it is well worth the effort

If you‚Äôre not tired, visit Kyichu Lhakang, a 7th century sanctuary located nearby and one of the oldest religious structures in the Kingdom. An absolute gem for history buffs and architecture enthusiasts alike, it is said to have two magical orange trees that bear fruit throughout the year.

As you return to the hotel after the hike, make sure you relax by heading to the sauna or booking yourself another hot-stone massage to make the aches and pains go away.



Spend your last day in Bhutan learning how to make the Prayer Flags that you‚Äôve seen everywhere in the country! You can book this experience directly at your hotel. Drive to the home of a local family that has been making prayer flags by hand for generations. Learn the secrets of their craft and make your own prayer flags before a hearty lunch of local favorites.

Wrap up your trip with a Butter Lamp Blessing. We visited the tiny 16th century Samtenling Monastery, just a ten-minute walk from our hotel. Here there are no tourists ‚Äì we lit 108 butter lamps, believed to dispel darkness in the Universe, and this was followed by a blessing led by the resident monks. It was a uniquely spiritual end to our trip in Bhutan

This is the perfect itinerary for a week-long trip in Bhutan. However if you have a few more days, we also suggest adding Gangtey and Bumthang to your itinerary of Bhutan as well. If you have any questions regarding Bhutan, leave them below and we‚Äôll get back to you as soon as possible üôÇ



Doha, the shimmering capital of Qatar, is a city of striking contrasts‚Äîwhere futuristic skylines meet time-honoured souqs, and luxury lifestyle mingles with deep-rooted tradition. This 4-day guide will walk you through an elevated and thoughtfully curated itinerary, featuring beach clubs, dhow cruises, cultural landmarks, and glamorous shopping districts ‚Äì perfect for a refreshing city break.

Doha is well connected to most major cities in the world and offers visa free access to citizens of many countries such as UK, USA etc. If you‚Äôre flying from India, you can get a free visa on arrival if you book hotels on the Discover Qatar website ‚Äì  This is very convenient and takes just minutes upon arrival.

Doha is really well connected by air from major cities in India ‚Äì we‚Äôd suggest booking a flight with Qatar Airways to enjoy the amazing service

Begin your journey at the Mondrian Doha, a five-star fantasyland designed by Dutch designer Marcel Wanders. Known for its bold interiors and art-centric spaces, the hotel makes an immediate impression with its grand staircase, lavish spa, and skyline views. Take a moment to unwind and soak in the blend of whimsical luxury and Arabian opulence.

The best time to visit Qatar is between November and February as these are the coolest months. However summer is not a bad time either as you can avail off-season prices on hotels and flights and many markets and restaurants in Doha have outdoor air-conditioning, so exploring the city is fun despite the high temperatures. Have fun eating, exploring, and make sure you shop loads as Qatar offers tax-free shopping.



Here‚Äôs a day by day guide for an unforgettable 4 day holiday in Qatar

Start your morning at Azure Beach Doha, located on the waterfront at the St. Regis Marsa Arabia Island. This exclusive beach club offers a resort-style vibe with infinity pools, sun loungers, and cabanas‚Äîall set against a pristine backdrop of turquoise Gulf waters. Order a smoothie or fresh seafood platter and let the vacation mindset sink in.

Pro Tip: Bring a swimsuit and sunscreen‚Äîthis spot is photogenic and perfect for laid-back lounging.



After a sunny morning, head to Baron, a bistro nestled in the colourful Mina District. Expect elegantly plated dishes with Middle Eastern flavours. Try their signature drinks or sharing platters ‚Äì this restaurant is on the Michelin Guide 2025 and it is easy to see why!





Next, explore the Mina District, a vibrant neighbourhood within the revitalised Old Doha Port. Colourful buildings, quirky cafes, and artisan shops make this one of Doha‚Äôs most Instagrammable neighbourhoods. It‚Äôs a cultural and architectural feast that combines modern flair with Gulf heritage.



As golden hour approaches, board a dhow cruise‚Äîa traditional Qatari wooden boat. Drift across the bay while taking in panoramic views of the West Bay skyline. Many cruises offer onboard tea and dates, adding to the ambience. Tickets cost around INR 500 per person, and it‚Äôs the best way to enjoy a beautiful sunset.



Return to The Pearl-Qatar to admire the Hamad bin Jassim Mosque, known for its minimalistic yet grand architectural design. Continue to the newly developed Gewan Island, a futuristic waterfront extension of The Pearl featuring fine dining, luxury boutiques, and marina views. Our favourite experience here was the Crystal Walk ‚Äì walking through a marketplace with outdoor air-conditioning is an experience in itself. But Crystal Walk is home to luxurious cafes, shops, and a light-display that is a joy to experience.



Begin your day with a leisurely breakfast in West Walk, a lifestyle hub in Al Waab known for its open-air design and curated food spots. Whether you‚Äôre into avocado toast, shakshuka, or cold brews, there are plenty of upscale cafes to choose from. We really like Piccolo ‚Äì think avocado toasts, acai bowls, really good coffee and smoothies! The best part is that West Walk is air-conditioned and you can sit outdoors even during peak summer months ‚Äì what a luxury!



Your cultural deep dive begins at the National Museum of Qatar, designed by Jean Nouvel and inspired by the desert rose. The museum walks you through Qatar‚Äôs journey‚Äîfrom Bedouin traditions to modern prosperity‚Äîwith immersive exhibits, audiovisual storytelling, and architecture that rivals any global landmark. The building is iconic from the outside but make sure you spend some time indoors ‚Äì you‚Äôll come back with a new appreciation for Qatari history and culture



Next, head to Place Vend√¥me Mall in Lusail Entertainment City, a Parisian-inspired shopping haven featuring over 500 luxury and mid-range boutiques. With its neoclassical architecture, dancing fountains, and waterfront promenade, it‚Äôs more than a mall‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifestyle destination. Browse fashion houses like Dior, Chanel, and Balmain or relax at one of the high-end caf√©s. Whether you shop or not, make sure you visit Place Vend√¥me to experience everything Doha has to offer



Wrap up the day with dinner at Carbone, located on Al Maha Island, an ultra-exclusive nightlife and leisure destination. The NYC-born restaurant offers decadent Italian-American fare in a Gatsby-esque setting. Food is scrumptious but portions are large, so order with caution. We suggest requesting a table on the outside deck so that you can enjoy beautiful views over sunset



Ease into the day with breakfast at Mondrian‚Äôs CUT by Wolfgang Puck or EllaMia Caf√©. Enjoy Middle Eastern and international dishes in a design-rich atmosphere. Check out of the hotel as you will be spending your final night in a gorgeous hotel just an hour away from Doha

Head to Katara Cultural Village, Doha‚Äôs arts and culture hub. Stroll through galleries, admire public art installations, and explore traditional architecture. Be sure to visit the Katara Mosque, known for its turquoise and gold detailing, and the amphitheater with its sweeping sea views. If you‚Äôre here during summer months, then schedule this visit for the evening, when it‚Äôs cooler.



Right next door is 21 High St., a luxury, air-conditioned (yes you read that right :-)) open-air shopping street featuring brands like Galeries Lafayette and curated boutiques. It‚Äôs a place where haute couture meets ice-sculpture caf√©s and avant-garde architecture. Perfect for a bit of shopping or a stroll



If you‚Äôd like yet more shopping, drive over to Al Hazm, a luxurious shopping mall that blends Italian marble with Qatari splendor. With its colonnades, glass domes, and indoor gardens, it feels more like a European palace than a shopping mall. Sip on saffron coffee or browse exclusive designer brands. If you‚Äôre an F1 fan, it is also home to the iconic Mc Laren caf√©, the first of its kind.



If time allows, take a walk through Msheireb Downtown, a smart city development that redefines modern Gulf architecture with sustainability and heritage in mind. Expect to find cafes, galleries, and museums dot the area before checking out of your hotel and beginning the drive to Ras Abrouq to catch sunset in the desert



Start your drive from Doha and catch sunset en-route in Zekreet -home to a traditional Arabic village and limestone formations that make sunset spectacular

Only 1.5 hours from Doha lies Our Habitas Ras Abrouq, an eco-luxury resort nestled along the wild, lunar-like landscapes of the Qatari desert near the UNESCO-listed Zekreet Peninsula. Enjoy yoga, mindful meals, and outdoor lounging with views of rock formations and the Arabian Gulf. The best part ‚Äì the star-laden night sky and the sheer silence of the countryside. We strongly suggest spending a night here.

Spend your morning at Our Habitas Ras Abrouq ‚Äì enjoy the hotel‚Äôs iconic pool, savour the food which prides itself on being a combination of Mexican, Indian, and Middle-Eastern flavours, and the quiet surroundings. This is a true desert escape.

Once you check-out, start your 1.5 hour drive back to Doha.



Return to Doha in the late afternoon and immerse yourself in Souq Waqif, the city‚Äôs historic marketplace. Lose yourself in a maze of spice stalls, fabric shops, and artisanal wares. Pick up oud perfume, pashmina scarves, or handcrafted souvenirs for friends and family back home.



End your Doha adventure with dinner at Parisa, a Persian restaurant within the Souq. Its mirrored mosaics, hand-painted ceilings, and chandeliers transport you to another world, while the menu serves rich dishes like kebabs, stews, and saffron rice. It‚Äôs best to reserve a table here beforehand as the place gets really busy in the evenings



This is the official end of your Doha escape  as you depart from Hamad International Airport. Ranked one of the best airports in the world, HIA offers a seamless travel experience with designer boutiques, art installations, and exceptional lounges. Don‚Äôt forget to shop a bit before boarding your flight back home.

In this 4-day Qatar itinerary we tried to balance coastal leisure, cultural richness, shopping, and dining. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a romantic getaway, a cultural deep-dive, or a luxe escape, Doha delivers an experience that‚Äôs both opulent and authentic. From dhow cruises to desert meditations, this will allow you to immerse yourself in the best the Qatari capital has to offer. If you have any questions, leave them below and we will answer them asap!!

Kyrgyzstan is a breathtaking gem of Central Asia and it used to be a vital stop on the Silk Road. If you‚Äôre travelling from India, it is ideal for travellers who have a week to spare and are seeking raw natural beauty, rich nomadic culture, and off-the-beaten-path adventures. It is often known as the ‚ÄúSwitzerland of Central Asia‚Äù and with good reason. Expect towering mountain ranges, lush valleys, and pristine alpine lakes

Over 90% of the country is covered by mountains ‚Äì this means dramatic landscapes perfect for trekking, horseback riding, and camping in yurts. The crown jewel of Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs natural wonders is Issyk-Kul Lake, the world‚Äôs second-largest alpine lake. Other must-visit destinations include the rugged beauty of Ala Archa National Park, the surreal red rock formations of Jeti-√ñg√ºz, and the untouched wilderness of Song-Kul Lake, where travelers can experience authentic nomadic life. Kyrgyzstan is one of the few countries that have retained its nomadic traditions, with locals still practicing eagle hunting, felt-making, and yurt-building

Here is everything you need to know before you visit Kyrgyzstan ‚Äì this itinerary provides the perfect combination of adventure, history, and culture Whether hiking through remote valleys, exploring ancient Silk Road relics, or simply sharing tea with nomads under a starry sky, a journey through Kyrgyzstan promises an unforgettable experience.

Here‚Äôs a detailed 5 to 6 day road trip itinerary for Kyrgyzstan, covering Bishkek, Issyk-Kul Lake, Ala Archa National Park, and Karakol

Aero Nomad offers direct flights from Delhi to Bishkek. However these don‚Äôt often show up on search engines, so you will need to book directly from their website. Our return flights cost approximately INR 40,000 ($500) per person. Alternatively you can take an indirect flight with Air Astana which is also cheaper.

Kyrgyzstan is visa-free for 7days if you have a valid, multiple-entry UK, USA, or Schengen visa (Please read details here). If not, you can apply for an e-visa to visit Kyrgyzstan, the details for which can be found here: Kyrgystan E-visa official. Please keep in mind that you‚Äôll need a Letter of Invitation from a Kyrgyz travel agent or a Kyrgyz national (see details below)

Download the Google Translate App and the Yandex App before you travel to Kyrgyzstan. Uber doesn‚Äôt work there and you can use Yandex to conveniently book cabs in bigger cities. English is understood only in big cities, so you will definitely need Google Translate for your one week trip in Kyrgyzstan.

We booked all our day trips and excursions in Kyrgyzstan with Visit Bishkek ‚Äì you can Whatsapp them on the number +996 707 727 888 ‚Äì they can also arrange an invitation letter for your visa at a cost, even if you are not booking travels with them. We found out about this tour provider from a friend and they were super safe and reliable!

Spend a day in Bishkek, the vibrant capital of Kyrgyzstan. Sheraton Bishkek and Novotel Bishkek City Centre are both good hotels and conveniently located to explore the city. We suggest choosing a nice and comfortable hotel in Bishkek as you will find only basic amenities once you head to the countryside on days 2 and 3.

Rest well and spend a day exploring Bishkek. Start your morning at Ala-Too Square, the heart of the city. Take some photos at the impressive Manas Statue, a tribute to the country‚Äôs legendary hero, and, if you‚Äôre lucky, witness the hourly changing of the guards. From here, a short walk will bring you to the ‚ÄúRussian Church‚Äù (you can put it on google maps) ‚Äì it‚Äôs a quiet and beautiful structure in the midst of the city‚Äôs commotion ‚Äì ideal if you enjoy city architecture photography.

From there, head to the bustling Osh Bazaar, one of Central Asia‚Äôs most authentic markets. Wander through the colourful stalls filled with fragrant spices, fresh produce, dried fruits, and traditional kurut (dried yogurt balls). This is also a great place to pick up handmade souvenirs for your house, such as felt carpets and traditional Kyrgyz hats (kalpaks).

For lunch, head to Navat, a cozy restaurant offering an authentic Central Asian dining experience. Try beshbarmak (noodles with meat), lagman (hand-pulled noodles), or manty (steamed dumplings), all served in a beautifully decorated setting with traditional Kyrgyz elements.

After lunch, visit the stunning Blue Mosque (Central Mosque of Imam Sarakhsi), an architectural masterpiece blending Ottoman and Central Asian influences. Make sure you include this as its intricate blue tile-work and peaceful ambiance makes it an under-rated gem in Bishkek.

Continue your exploration with a leisurely walk through Oak Park & Erkindik Boulevard, a green oasis in the city. The park is home to Soviet-era sculptures, outdoor caf√©s, and tree-lined paths perfect for relaxing. Erkindik Boulevard, a pedestrian-friendly street, is ideal for soaking in the city‚Äôs lively atmosphere.

End your day at a caf√© along Erkindik, sipping tea or Kyrgyz coffee while reflecting on Bishkek‚Äôs unique mix of history, culture, and modern charm.



Leave for a 2 day trip to the South Shore of Issyk-kul Lake. We suggest booking a private car with driver for this. This 2 day trip costs approximately $650 including car, accommodation, and meals and we booked it with Visit Bishkek as previously mentioned.

Start your trip early, driving 1.5 hours from Bishkek to the Burana Tower, a 10th-century minaret and a remnant of the ancient Silk Road city of Balasagun. Climb the tower for panoramic views and explore the surrounding balbal (stone warrior statues) that date back to the Turkic era.

Next, continue to Aksai Canyon, a hidden gem with dramatic red rock formations. Take a short hike to enjoy breathtaking views over the rugged landscapes. The canyon is much less visited than other sites, so you might not see many people around. A 4√ó4 is recommended for this üôÇ

In the afternoon, arrive at the south shore of Issyk-Kul Lake, where you can experience a traditional yurt stay. This is the more scenic shore of the lake, so it‚Äôs the ideal place to spend a night! Enjoy a delicious Kyrgyz meal, relax by the lake, and take in the stunning sunset over the Terskey Alatau mountains. In the evening, sit by the fire, listen to local legends, and gaze at the star-filled sky.





Wake up early for a short drive to Fairytale (Skazka) Canyon, named for its surreal, multi-colored rock formations that resemble castles, animals, and mystical creatures. Hike through the otherworldly landscape, exploring the deep red and orange cliffs shaped by wind and water over centuries.

After the hike, we suggest driving further towards Barskoon Waterfalls, in the Jeti-√ñg√ºz district ‚Äì     it‚Äôs a beautiful drive through lush green mountains, and the multi-tiered falls are worth hiking for.  From here you can continue onto Karakol or head back to Bishkek, arriving by early evening. This two-day adventure offers a perfect mix of history, nature, and nomadic culture, making it an unforgettable Kyrgyz experience.



You can take Day 4 to rest and spend a slow day in Bishkek after the long drives and hikes in the countryside. On Day 5, it is time for a day trip to Ala Archa National Park

Leave Bishkek early in the morning for a 45-minute drive to the park entrance. The road winds through picturesque landscapes before reaching the Ala Archa Gorge, where snow-capped peaks and dense forests create a stunning backdrop. From the main parking area, choose the Ak-Sai Waterfall Trail, a moderate hike leading to a stunning waterfall. The trail ascends through rocky terrain, offering panoramic views of glaciers and towering peaks. This hike takes around 2-3 hours round trip, making it ideal for those wanting a balanced mix of adventure and relaxation.

If you are with parents or kids, skip the hike and take a short walk along the Ala Archa River. And if you‚Äôre an adventurous hiker, then take the path to Ratsek Hut ‚Äì a longer, steeper trail popular among climbers.

No matter which of the three routes you choose ‚Äì enjoy a picnic lunch in the valley, surrounded by towering fir trees and the sound of the river flowing through the gorge. You can request your guide to pack some local snacks like samsa, dried fruits, and fresh bread, or stop by a caf√© near the park entrance.

After that it is time to return to Bishkek and pack for your flight the next day



That is it ‚Äì everything you need to plan a trip from India to Kyrgyzstan. We‚Äôve tried to cover everything from flights to visas to local tour operators to apps that you will need to plan the perfect trip to Kyrgyzstan.

Most people aren‚Äôt born savvy travelers. It‚Äôs something that only comes with on-the-road experience. Travel savviness is a process born of missed buses, foolish behavior, cultural unawareness, and countless tiny errors. Then, one day, you begin to seamlessly move through airports and integrate yourself into new cultures like a fish to water.

In the beginning, you‚Äôll make a lot of travel mistakes.But I want to help speed up the process and help you avoid my mistakes (and I often make a lot of them), so I put together this giant list of my best travel tips that cover everything under the sun to help you reach your full travel ninja potential.

I‚Äôve learned these tips over almost twenty years of being a nomad.

These tips for traveling will have you saving money, sleeping better, getting off the beaten path more, meeting locals, and just being a better traveler.

So, without further ado, here are the best 61 travel tips in the world:

1. Always pack a towel. It‚Äôs the key to successful galactic hitchhiking ‚Äî and plain common sense. You never know when you will need it, whether it‚Äôs at the beach, on a picnic, or just to dry off after a shower. While many hostels offer towels, you never know if they will or not, and carrying a small towel won‚Äôt add that much weight to your bag.

Make sure it‚Äôs a lightweight, quick-drying towel since regular towels are too bulky and heavy (and they take a long time to dry). Dry Fox travel towels are my favorite (use the code ‚Äúnomadicmatt‚Äù for 15% off your purchase)!

2. Use a small backpack/suitcase. By purchasing a small backpack (I like something around 35‚Äì45 liters), you will be forced to pack light and avoid carrying too much stuff. Humans have a natural tendency to want to fill space. Even if you pack light initially but have lots of extra room in your bag, you‚Äôll end up going, ‚ÄúWell, I guess I can take more‚Äù and fill that space.‚Äù

You‚Äôll regret it later as you‚Äôll be carrying around a bunch of stuff you don‚Äôt need as well as more weight on your shoulders. This article has more tips on finding the best travel backpack for your needs.

The same rule applies to suitcases. Don‚Äôt take a huge suitcase because they are a pain in the butt to lug around, especially if you‚Äôre traveling long term (short term, not so much). I like Level 8 suitcases. They are durable, quite spacious, nicely designed, and well-priced (luggage can be pretty damn expensive). Plus, they have a TSA lock built into the zipper. You can click here to learn more and buy one.

I also recommend packing cubes, which are essential if you‚Äôre going to be living out of a backpack for a few weeks (or months), or you just want to keep your suitcase better organized. They come in a variety of sizes, allowing you to store items big and small. They‚Äôre great for making it easy to find everything in your backpack or suitcase.

3. Pack light. Write down a list of essentials, cut it in half, and then only pack that! Plus, since you bought a small backpack like I said above, you won‚Äôt have much room for extra stuff anyways! Take half the clothes you think you will need‚Ä¶you won‚Äôt need as much as you think. It‚Äôs OK to wear the same t-shirt a few days in a row.

I love Unbound Merino, as their travel clothing can be worn daily for weeks without getting smelly. They are super light and they look stylish too. I really love the material, they‚Äôre comfortable, they hardly ever need a wash, and they last forever! (I wrote a review of the company here.)

But bring extra socks! You‚Äôll lose a bunch to laundry gremlins, wear and tear, and hiking so packing extra will come in handy. Take a few more than you need. Trust me on this.

For a complete list of what I pack, click here to read my post.

4. Stay in hostels.  They are cheap, organize events, you‚Äôll meet a lot of people, and they are just tons of fun! Plus, hostel bars sell cheap beer. Hostelworld is the best hostel-accommodation site out there, with the largest inventory, best search interface, and highest availability. I use it for all my hostel bookings.

Here‚Äôs my list of all my favorite hostels around the world broken down by city.

If you‚Äôre planning on backpacking Europe, it‚Äôs worth getting HostelPass, a card that gives you up to 20% off hostels throughout Europe. It‚Äôs a great way to save money, and they‚Äôre constantly adding new hostels too. I‚Äôve always wanted something like this and so I‚Äôm glad it finally exists. Use code NOMADICMATT for 25% off.

5. Take an extra bank card and credit card with you Disasters happen and things get stolen or compromised. I once had a card duplicated and a freeze put on it. I couldn‚Äôt use it for the rest of my trip. I was very happy I had a backup. You don‚Äôt want to be stuck somewhere new without access to your funds. This happened to a friend once and they had to borrow money from me for weeks while they waited for their new card to arrive. Here are some helpful articles on banking:

6. Make sure to use no-fee bank and credit cards. Don‚Äôt give banks your hard-earned money. Keep that for yourself and spend it on your travels. Get a credit card and debit card that doesn‚Äôt charge a foreign transaction fee or an ATM fee. Over the course of a long trip, the few dollars they take every time will really add up! This article will tell you how to do that.

7. Don‚Äôt always fly direct. When booking flights, sometimes it is cheaper to fly to airports close to your final destination, and then take a train, bus, or budget airline to your final destination. To use this method, find out how much it is to go directly to your destination. Then, look at prices to nearby airports. If the difference is more than $150 USD, I look to see how much it is to get from the second airport to my primary destination.

My favorite flight search engine is Skyscanner. This is my go-to website for finding cheap flights. It searches a lot of different airlines, including many of the budget carriers that larger sites miss.

8. Travel by yourself at least once.  Solo travel teaches independence and confidence. It‚Äôs a clich√©, but it‚Äôs true. Traveling solo taught me how to fend for myself, talk to people, and handle unfamiliar situations with ease. It can take some getting used to if you‚Äôve never done it before but do it at least once. Make yourself uncomfortable and surprise yourself. You‚Äôll learn valuable life skills when you push yourself! Here are some helpful articles on solo travel:

9. Always visit the local tourism information center. This is probably one of the most underused travel tips in the world. Tourism information centers know about everything going on in town. They can point you to free activities, special events happening during your stay, and everything in between. They even offer discounts on attractions and transportation. It is their job to help you experience the destination better. They are staffed by locals who can tell you all the ins and outs of their city and where to eat or drink that aren‚Äôt filled with tourists.

Plus, they often offer city tourism cards that can get you into multiple attractions for one set price, saving you a lot of money if you are going to do a lot of sightseeing.

10. Take free walking tours. Besides being free, these tours will give you a good orientation and background of the city you are visiting. I love, love, love taking walking tours when I travel. You pass the time, you get to pepper the guide with questions, and you get to learn so much about where you are. And, in the last few years, they have exploded in popularity and now most cities around the world have one!

This page here lists all my favorite walking tour companies, broken down by city.

If you‚Äôre looking for paid tours, Walks is one of my favorite paid walking tour companies, offering in-depth history and cultural tours in cities around the world (especially Europe). Its small-group tours also tend to offer exclusive behind-the-scenes access you can‚Äôt get elsewhere. For fellow foodies, Devour Food Tours has all kinds of amazing food tours around Europe.

You can also use Get Your Guide to find plenty of unique day tours.

11. Don‚Äôt be afraid to use a map. Looking like a tourist isn‚Äôt as bad as getting really lost and ending up in the wrong neighborhood. Don‚Äôt be afraid to use a map or ask for directions and look like a tourist. After all, you are one!

12. But don‚Äôt be afraid to get purposefully lost. Wandering aimlessly through a new city is a good way to get to know it, get off the beaten path, and away from the tourists. You might be surprised by the hidden gems you find. I like to wander around and try to find my way without using Google Maps. Travel is the art of discovery and you never know what cool little spot you‚Äôll come across.

13. Ask hostel staff for information ‚Äî even when you aren‚Äôt staying there. Hostel staff deal with budget travelers all day, every day. They know exactly where to go for cheap meals and attractions. They also tend to be locals so they know the city very well. Ask them for all sorts of information. Even if you aren‚Äôt staying in one, just pop in and ask for help. They‚Äôll usually give it.

14. Sign up for flight deals. When it comes to travel, your flight(s) will likely be your biggest expense. Save money by signing up for flight deal websites. You‚Äôll get epic flight deals straight to your inbox, saving you time and money. Also be sure to sign up for airline newsletters, since that is where they will announce their sales first.

The best websites for finding travel deals are:

15. When you go out, take only what you need.  Limit the amount of cash and bank cards you carry with you when you go out, so if something does happen, you can easily recover. Never take more than one credit card or ATM card with you. My rule for cash is to limit what I carry to $50 USD.

16. Always carry a lock. Carry a small combination lock with you when you travel. They come in handy, especially when you stay in dorms. Most hostels use lockers, so budget travelers need to provide their own travel lock to keep stuff secured. While you can usually rent or buy them at hostels, it‚Äôs much cheaper just to buy one before you go. (Just don‚Äôt use one with keys because if you lose the keys, you‚Äôre screwed!)

17. Make extra copies of your passport and important documents. Don‚Äôt forget to email a copy to yourself too. You never know when you might need to have some sort of documentation with you and might not want to carry your original. Additionally, if your passport gets stolen, having a copy will come in handy for your police report.

18. Learn basic phrases in the native language of your destination. The locals will appreciate it and it will make your interactions easier. You don‚Äôt need to master the language but learning a few things like ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù ‚ÄúGoodbye,‚Äù ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the bathroom?‚Äù will go a long way to endearing yourself with the locals. They‚Äôll like that you tried. Here are some tips on how to learn a language.

19. Don‚Äôt be ashamed to walk into a Starbucks or McDonald‚Äôs. Sometimes familiarity is comforting and both places have free wifi and public restrooms you can use. (Just don‚Äôt eat the food at McDonald‚Äôs! That shit is gross and unhealthy for you! You can get it back home!). Libraries and most modern coffee shops also have free Wi-Fi too.

20. Always get behind business travelers when in security lines. They move fast since they are usually in a rush and travel light. They know the drill. Line up behind them as much as possible. You‚Äôll speed through the line!

21. Never get behind families in airport security. They take forever. It‚Äôs not their fault. They just have a lot of stuff because of the kids. Try to avoid getting in lines with lots of kids. It‚Äôs going to take a while.

22. When you check in to the hotel, don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for an upgrade. They have a lot of flexibility when it comes to assigning upgrades at check-in. It never hurts to ask. Oftentimes they can accommodate you if the hotel isn‚Äôt full. Just be super nice!

Note: If you stay in hotels frequently (or want to), it might be worth it to get a hotel credit card. You can earn points on your everyday spending at home and convert those points into free stays. The best cards come with status, making upgrades more likely too!

23. Lunchtime is the best time to visit historical sites. Lunch time is one of the best times to visit historical sites. You‚Äôll have fewer crowds getting in your way as big tour buses, groups, and most travelers head to lunch. It‚Äôs always best to visit an attraction super early, late, or when people eat. You‚Äôll have even the most popular places to yourself!

24. Never eat in a touristy area or near a tourist attraction. I don‚Äôt eat within five blocks of a major tourist attraction or area. I simply walk in any direction and search for a place to eat when I hit five blocks. There‚Äôs an invisible line at this area: tourists don‚Äôt go past it. All of a sudden you notice that the crowds are gone, and that‚Äôs when you want to start looking.

Sure, you might find a good meal in a tourist area, but you‚Äôll find a better, cheaper meal outside it. Go where the menus aren‚Äôt in multiple languages. Go to those little tiny hole in the wall places that you are unsure about. The meal might not knock your socks off each time but it will be a memorable and more local experience.

Use websites like Yelp or Google Maps to find some delicious and popular restaurants around you.

25. Locals don‚Äôt eat out every night and neither should you. Go grocery shopping. You can learn a lot about locals‚Äô diets by seeing the type of food they buy. Plus, it will save you a lot of money. You won‚Äôt regret it. Cook your food, save money, and surprise yourself!

26. Eat at expensive restaurants during lunch.  Most expensive restaurants offer lunch specials featuring the same food they would serve for dinner but for a fraction of the cost! That‚Äôs the best time to eat out when you travel. I share more tips on how to eat cheaply around the world here.

27. Pack a headlamp. This is a handy tool for both backpackers and anyone looking to do any hiking or camping. If you‚Äôre going to be staying in a hostel, having a headlamp is helpful when you need to check in or out but don‚Äôt want to disturb your fellow travelers by turning on the lights. They‚Äôre also helpful in emergencies.

28. Carry a basic first-aid kit. Accidents happen, so be prepared. I always take band-aids, antibacterial cream, and ointments for minor cuts and scrapes. You never know when you‚Äôre going to need it and you can‚Äôt always get it when you travel.

You can either assemble a first aid kit yourself (here are some tips for doing so), or purchase a pre-made kit online.

29. Don‚Äôt believe the cheap flight myths. Don‚Äôt drive yourself too crazy trying to get the absolute cheapest fare. There are a lot of myths online about how to find cheap flights, but there is no magic bullet or one secret ninja trick. It‚Äôs not cheaper to book on a particular day of the week or if you search in an incognito window. To learn how to actually find a cheap flight, check out these two posts I wrote:

My favorite company for finding cheap flights is Skyscanner. I start all my searches there.

30. Use technology to meet locals. These websites will help you get an insider‚Äôs perspective on your destination by connecting you with locals in the places you visit. The sharing economy has changed the way people travel allowing you to meet locals, get off the tourist travel, and save mega money! It‚Äôs a triple win ‚Äî and I use these resources all the time when I travel.

Here‚Äôs an article on how to use the sharing economy (and what websites to use) when you travel.

31. Be open to strangers. Not everyone bites. Say hi to people on the road. Turn strangers into friends. Remember they are just like you! They want to live a happy, full life and have hopes and dreams too! You never know. You just might make some lifelong friends.

32. But keep your guard up. Some people do bite, so keep a healthy level of suspicion. You don‚Äôt want to fall for any travel scams or get yourself into uncomfortable situations. Be open but cautious. Here is a list of travel scams to avoid.

33. Avoid taxis. They are always a budget buster. Never, ever take a taxi unless you absolutely have too!

34. Take a reusable water bottle through airport security and fill it up at your gate. Single-use plastics are common in a lot of countries around the world. They‚Äôre also polluting our oceans and destroying the environment. Drink from the tap when you can ‚Äî you‚Äôll save money and help the environment. If you‚Äôre going somewhere where you can‚Äôt drink the water, be sure to get a water bottle with a filter. I love Lifestraw.

35. Take pictures of your luggage and clothes. If your bag gets lost, this will help identify it more easily and speed up the process of having your travel insurance reimburse you.

36. Carry emergency cash. Because emergencies happen, like that time in Romania when I couldn‚Äôt find an ATM and needed money for the bus to the hostel. I usually try to keep around $200 USD in emergency cash in case something happens!

37. Get vaccinated. Because falling prey to an illness in a foreign country is not fun ‚Äî and many countries require you to get vaccinated in order to visit them. So regardless of your opinion on the subject, you just might have to.

Here is an article on how to stay healthy on the road.

38. Learn to haggle. Haggling is a fun, playful way of not getting charged the foreigner price. It‚Äôs the art of negotiating and one that will help you throughout all of life, not just at the market. Just don‚Äôt argue over pennies ‚Äî it‚Äôs not worth it!

39. Use points and miles for free travel.  You can go a lot further in the world when you don‚Äôt have to pay for it. Learn how to collect points and miles through your everyday spending so you can get free flights, accommodation, train tickets, and other forms of travel. It‚Äôs what all expert travelers do to lower their travel costs and something you should do too!

Here are some articles to help you get started with using points and miles:

40. Eat street food! If you skip the street food, you miss out on culture. Don‚Äôt be scared. If you‚Äôre nervous, look for places where kids are eating. If it‚Äôs safe for them, it‚Äôs safe for you.

41. Get travel insurance. Travel insurance is the most important thing to get that you never want to use. If something goes wrong, you don‚Äôt want to be out thousands of dollars in bills. Travel insurance will be there if you get robbed, flights get canceled, you get sick or injured, or have to be sent home. It‚Äôs comprehensive and, for just a few dollars a day, one of the best investments you can get for a trip.

You may think you‚Äôre superman/woman but so did my friend who broke her arm, didn‚Äôt have insurance, and had to pay thousands out of pocket. Insurance was there when I had to replace my camera and when I popped an eardrum scuba diving! Get it! Here are some tips on how to find the best travel insurance.

My favorite companies are:

42. Be patient. Things will work out in the end. No need to rush. You‚Äôll get to where you are going in due time. Travel is about the journey, not the destination.

43. Be respectful. Locals are willing to help you out, but there‚Äôs probably a language barrier, so keep your cool when something doesn‚Äôt go your way. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll end up just looking like an asshole tourist.

44. Don‚Äôt over plan your trip. Let your days unfold naturally. Schedule two or three things and let the day fill in the rest on its own. It‚Äôs less stressful, and letting the day just take you is one of the best ways to travel. Here‚Äôs my advice on how not to over plan your travels!

45. Be frugal ‚Äî but not cheap.  Don‚Äôt be penny wise but pound-foolish. Look for deals and don‚Äôt waste money, but don‚Äôt miss out on great experiences or walk 10 miles to save a couple of dollars. Time is money. Spend them both wisely.

46. Take earplugs. Anyone who has ever stayed in a hostel knows that earplugs are a necessity. Snorers are everywhere and you need your sleep. Even if you‚Äôre not going to be in a hostel, they‚Äôre still helpful for sleeping well if your accommodation is located on a busy street, or for sleeping in buses, overnight trains, and other types of transportation. A good night‚Äôs sleep is priceless ‚Äî be prepared!

These earplugs are reusable and work much better than the cheap foam ones, blocking out any distracting noises.

47. Remember that you‚Äôre not alone even if you‚Äôre traveling solo. Traveling alone never means you‚Äôre really alone. Wherever you go, there is a network of travelers who will be your friends, give you advice or tips, and help you out. They will guide you, point you in the right direction, and be your mentors. You aren‚Äôt out there on your own. You‚Äôll make lots of friends and tons of memories.

If you‚Äôre not sure about traveling on your own for the first time, you can always join a group tour, such as those we offer at The Nomadic Network. I‚Äôve designed all the itineraries myself to ensure they cover the highlights, get you off the tourist trail, and connect you with friends and locals.

48. Take photos of and with people.   When you do make those new friends on the road, take photos. Lots of photos. Years from now, you‚Äôll want to look back on those nights you can‚Äôt remember and the people who made them memorable.

49. Pre-book your tickets to attractions, activities, and excursions online. If you‚Äôre planning to do any activities or excursions on your trip, book them online. Companies usually offer a discounted price when compared to buying in person. Not only that but you‚Äôll be able to pay with a credit card, giving you some extra protection as well as more travel points!

Many major attractions also allow you to reserve your spot and skip the line. Always look online to see if this is an option. This will help you avoid wasting time in multi-hour lines and go right in. I‚Äôve seen people wait hours for the Paris Catacombs, Louvre, London Churchill War Rooms, churches, temples, historic fortresses, and more. Pre-book the day before, skip the line, get to see more during your day!

Get Your Guide is my favorite place to book activities in advance. It‚Äôs a huge online marketplace for tours and excursions, with tons of options in cities all around the world, including skip-the-line attraction tickets, cooking classes, walking tours, and more!

50. Avoid TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor is fine when you need opening hours or an address, but when it comes to reviews I ignore it completely. People always leave a negative review when something bad happens but rarely leave a positive review when something good happens so the reviews tend to be skewed.

On top of that, it‚Äôs very easy to create fake reviews and make a place seem better than it is. Many hotels and restaurants hire firms to artificially inflate their reviews on the platform. Additionally, TripAdvisor has been known to take down reviews that are overly negative as well as reviews on sexual assault. Use TripAdvisor with caution. Or better yet, don‚Äôt use it at all.

51. Finally, wear sunscreen. For as the Baz Luhrmann song ‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs Free (To Wear Sunscreen)‚Äù goes:

If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists Whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable Than my own meandering experience.

I used to think ‚Äúhome‚Äù was a dirty word. Out there ‚Äî on the road ‚Äî was where life happened, full of exciting adventures, fascinating people, and endless possibilities. No dreary commutes, 30-minute lunch breaks, mind-numbing meetings, or endless lists of to-dos squeezed into a rushed weekend.

Why would anyone want to be home, the place where routine seemed to sap your will to exist? It baffled me.

My first trip overseas ‚Äî a vacation to Costa Rica ‚Äî made me fall in love with travel. For all the reasons mentioned above, I realized why ‚Äúvacations‚Äù were so romanticized in work culture. There was a freedom to them that stood in stark contrast to the daily corporate grind.

So, when I finally quit my job, I set off on an adventure to experience all the world had to offer for as long as I could make my money last.

I mean, who could possibly tire of life on the road?

Well, me.

Eventually, I did tire of being a full-time nomad. I craved a stable group of friends, regular workouts, a bar that knew my name, a kitchen to cook in, and my own bed.

Suddenly, I realized that ‚Äúhome‚Äù wasn‚Äôt a dirty word. It just felt that way to a young, restless soul for whom adulthood felt eons away.

I had come to understand what someone who is just setting out with romantic notions about travel couldn‚Äôt: You can burn out. On my first trip abroad, after 18 months, I hit the wall and decided to cut my trip short. Then, years later, in 2013, I decided that being a nomad was no longer the life for me and decided to stop traveling full-time.

It was time to grow up, I said. Time to stay put and move on from nomad to‚Ä¶ whatever came next.

But the allure of the road ‚Äî and the business of working in travel ‚Äî pulled me back constantly.

As the years went by, I lived between two worlds: one in which I am traveling, longing for home, and another in which I am home, longing to head out again.

There were moments where I longed for a clone so I could live in both and satisfy my dual desires.

After all, you can‚Äôt ‚Äî and shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äî live solely in one forever.

Because travel and home are complementary forces, yin and yang. Without one, you can‚Äôt appreciate the other.

All travelers hit a wall, that moment when they look around and go, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to stay in one place.‚Äù When and why that happens is a product of many factors, but I have yet to meet a traveler who doesn‚Äôt have that experience. When I started traveling in my twenties, it took me years to feel that. But now, a couple of decades older, it happens after just a month.

To handle life, the brain creates mental shortcuts to help it process information. It‚Äôs why we tend to drive the same route to work every day ‚Äî it‚Äôs just easier, and it‚Äôs why you feel like ‚Äúyou can do it in your sleep.‚Äù Because if your brain had to figure out a new route to work every day, it would tire itself out. These routines let us put a lot of life on autopilot, so we have energy for work, people, emotions, thoughts, etc.

But when you travel, you are relearning life skills every day. You have no mental shortcuts. It takes a lot of mental energy to figure out your way in the world anew each day, to repack your bag, say good-bye to the person you met yesterday, and head out and try again to navigate unfamiliar lands, languages, and people as if you had never done so before.

It tires you out.

Whereas a vacation is a temporary break from life, long-term travel is different. When you travel long-term (or are on the move frequently), there is no break. You‚Äôre constantly trying to figure things out and also constantly breaking your routine. Your travel battery drains.

Yet in the same way the travel battery needs to be recharged, our ‚Äúhome‚Äù battery does too.

While some people can follow the same routine their entire lives, most of us can‚Äôt. We find it boring. We need a break. After a while in one place, we yearn to break up the monotony of our daily routine. Work, commutes, errands‚Ä¶ day in, day out, like ants marching on and on.

So we go travel again. We have an adventure, meet new people, try new food, and have new experiences. Maybe be learn, grow, and expand who we are as a person. Maybe we‚Äôre away for a week or two or we take a month off. Or we start working remotely and spend months away. But eventually our battery drains: we get tired, and then we head home again.

And the cycle repeats.

Growing older has made me believe that we can never fully appreciate home or travel without the other. My first years on the road would never have been so amazing if I weren‚Äôt trying to break free from a quarter-century of routine. Likewise, my bed never would have felt so good had I not spent so many years on the move, changing rooms, and having erratic sleep. Nor would I have enjoyed the relief that routine brings had I not spent so many days trying to navigate the stresses of the world for so long.

The joy of one is amplified by the other.

Travel and home are two sides to the same coin. I appreciate each more now than when I was younger, because I get to experience both on my own terms. I‚Äôm not trying to run away from either or go to an extreme anymore. I simply follow their ebb and flow and let the battery of life dictate when one or the other happens.
